# vscode-language-xi
"Xi" is a markdown-like language designed for a personal knowledge base.
Color and indentation is used to highlight headers, paragraphs, links,
source code examples and definitions. You can read and write Xi from
within a VSCode without a need to "render" it into a "visual" web page
or PDF. This makes Xi a very **fast** tool to keep records: you grep
someting, skim through Xi pages, add or change some text from within a same
editor, without a need to switch between 'edit' and 'previes' modes. An
example of Xi page from my personal knowledge base with "Memory" color theme:
